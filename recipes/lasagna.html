    <h1>Description</h1>

    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that layers pasta, meat sauce, and cheese into a hearty casserole. To prepare, brown ground beef or Italian sausage with onions and garlic, then add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and Italian herbs. Simmer the sauce to develop rich flavors.</p>

    <p>Mix ricotta cheese with a beaten egg, parsley, and Parmesan for the filling. In a baking dish, layer the meat sauce, uncooked lasagna noodles, ricotta mixture, and shredded mozzarella. Repeat the layers, finishing with a top layer of sauce and cheese. Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 50 minutes, removing the foil halfway through to let the cheese brown. Let it rest before serving for the best texture.</p>
